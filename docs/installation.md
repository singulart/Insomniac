## Installation
If you prefer video lessons, welcome to the [Udemy Course](https://insomniac-bot.com/udemy_course/). We'll go through all installation steps together!

### Windows
1. Download and install python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Better choose latest stable release.
2. Open Command Prompt.
3. Run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` to make sure you've got the latest pip version.
4. Run `python -m pip install insomniac` to install insomniac package.
5. Download [start.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexal1/Insomniac/master/start.py) to a directory where you're going to launch the script from (right-click on the link, then Save As).
6. Download and unzip [Android platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools), move them to a folder where you won't delete them accidentally. Standard place is `C:\Users\<your username>\Android\sdk\platform-tools\`.
7. [Add platform-tools path to the PATH environment variable](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/wiki/Adding-platform-tools-to-the-PATH-environment-variable). If you do it correctly, Command Prompt command `adb devices` will print `List of devices attached`.
8. Connect your Android phone via USB cable _or_ use [emulator](https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-install-43543116).
